  ## Branching Strategy

Each project repository will follow a branching strategy to ensure code quality and efficient collaboration:

- **Main Branch (`main`):** The `main` branch contains the stable, production-ready code. All completed features and fixes will be merged into this branch.
- **Development Branch (`develop`):** The `develop` branch is used for ongoing development and integration. All feature branches will be merged into this branch for testing and review before being merged into `main`.
- **Feature Branches:** Each new feature or task will have its own branch, named `feature/<feature-name>`. These branches are created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` upon completion.
- **Bugfix Branches:** Any bug fixes will be addressed in `bugfix/<bug-name>` branches, created from `develop` or `main` as appropriate.
- **Release Branches:** When preparing a new release, a `release/<version>` branch will be created from `develop` for final testing and adjustments. Once ready, it will be merged into `main` and tagged.

### Example Workflow:
1. Create a new feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
